## 🧬 About Me
I am a bioinformatician with experience in neuroscience and oncology research.  
I work with a variety of omics datasets and enjoy developing reproducible analytical pipelines and extracting meaningful insights from complex biological data.

I am currently looking for opportunities where I can apply and further develop my skills in real-world research or industry environments. I’m motivated to contribute to impactful projects, collaborate with multidisciplinary teams and continue growing as a data-driven problem solver.

- 💬 **Ask me about:** single-cell workflows, spatial transcriptomics, reproducible pipelines or turning messy datasets into clean insights.
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I often test new visualisation techniques just to make data interpretation clearer.
